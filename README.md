# QuoteRacer
A Discord bot that joins a voice channel and says a quote, the first person to type the quote correctly wins.

# Commands
I forgot to finish the *help command and am too lazy now so here are the commands:

*join - Joins your voice channel
*startrace - Starts the race
*repeat - Repeats the quote
*leave - Leaves the voice channel (you must be in the same VC as the bot for it to work)
